# The Black Arms SDX is DISCONTINUED  
I stopped work on TBASDX for many reasons and it is still never coming back  
Instead I have a TOS compliant toolkit in the works for everyone to use  
[Project Zenith](https://github.com/Project-Zenith/ZPUK) was the original project but I have something new coming  

# Note about fake versions of The Black Arms SDX  
## This includes fake versions of The Black Arms SDX  
I will never write code for The Black Arms unless it is TOS COMPLIANT for what its for  
People seem to have been left in the dark without my work  
I understand that but at the same time I'm glad most rippers gave up after the shutdown  
That is why I am here starting anew, But as an actual creator this time around
