# The Black Arms is RETIRED  
I have let TheBlackArmsSDX shut down for several reasons, I don't want it brought back either  
The reputation it died with is enough of a reason for me to avoid using the name  
I have started a new project with a new name and a fresh slate  
You can visit the new project at [Zenith Productions](https://github.com/Zenith-Productions/Zenith-Unity-Kit)  
This time I want to make the swiss army knife of Unity3D with scripts and tools for everything  

# Note about fake versions of The Black Arms  
## This includes fake versions of The Black Arms SDX  
I will never return to this name ever again  
People seem to have been left in the dark without my work  
I recently finally got the drive to go back to doing what I did before  
That is why I am starting [Zenith Productions](https://github.com/Zenith-Productions/Zenith-Unity-Kit)
